The Friendly Game Of War

A streamlined version of the classic card game. No shuffling, dealing or counting required, the computer will do it all for you. 
In this version, if the drawn cards are equal the computer will yeild to the player giving them a slight advantage.. this isn't a Vegas card game!
The hand is the amount of cards yet to be played and the reserve is the amount of cards each player has won to replenish their hand.
The game will end when either the Player or the Computer has all 52 cards.

The technologies used were: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

One button will click through and deal the cards for each turn

Icebox items include:
Adding a sleeker more refined design and layout
Getting the multiple card War feature with different face down and face up settings.
Adding a war button that will also disallow the player from pressing draw cards
